					The Nrityagram community knits together the trees of our dance village,
					<br />
					the teachers whose careful eye instructs not only the alignment of the limbs but of body and spirit,
					<br />
					the students who spend hours perfecting the art,
          <br />
					the tiny insects who are masters of organic architecture,
					<br />
					our shy friend the Paradise Flycatcher,          
          <br />
					our families and friends who are our lifeblood,
					<br />
					the mango blossoms whose scented greetings bless us every summer,
					<br />
					our food forest whose bounty we gratefully share,
					<br />
					our patrons and audiences who support and cheer us across world stages, real and virtual,
					<br />
					and artistic souls around the globe.
				</p>

        <p>
					Our community draws on the wisdom of ancient teachers whose fierce intellect and creativity gave us the art
					that we now practice and nurture.
				</p>

        <p>
					Our community is a sanctuary for creative spirits, a crucible for excellence, and a talisman of hope in these
					uncertain times.
				</p>

        <p>Our community is our past, present and ever evolving future.</p>

        <p>Our community transcends the boundaries of time and space.</p>
        <p>Our community is within you, my friend, whoever you are, tree, bird, flower, or human.</p>
