			We aim to prepare dancers for careers that combine performance with teaching, community outreach, and leadership.
			To enrich their practice, dancers are taught yoga, meditation, martial arts as well as Sanskrit and literature.
		</p>
    <p>
			Choreographers, movement-specialists, sculptors, painters, writers, musicians and theatre practitioners from all
			over the world frequently visit Nrityagram. They perform and conduct workshops and seminars in their area of
			practice, to further deepen the breadth of our dancer’s knowledge.
		</p>
    <p>
			The daily schedule of the Nrityagram dancers includes a unique, scientific body-conditioning and training
			programme that is sourced from <em>Yoga,</em>
      <em>Natyashastra,</em>
      <em>Kalaripayattu,</em> Western fitness methods and Odissi body-conditioning exercises. This makes the practice of dance injury-proof and increases the performance lifespan of a dancer. This technique is now sought-after by accomplished dancers and performers from different disciplines and we frequently teach and advise performers how to benefit from our body-conditioning and training programme.
